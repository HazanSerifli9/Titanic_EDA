# Titanic_EDA
Welcome to the Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project! In this project, I dive deep into the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights through data visualization.

🛠️ Project Overview

This project focuses on the Titanic dataset, a classic dataset that has been widely analyzed in the data science community. My goal was to perform an in-depth exploratory analysis, separating and visualizing both categorical and numerical data to draw meaningful conclusions.

🔍 Key Features

Data Segmentation: The dataset was segmented into categorical and numerical variables to provide clearer insights.
Visual Insights: I used a variety of visualizations to explore the relationships between different features, such as survival rate by gender, class, age, and more.
Statistical Analysis: Key statistics were calculated to support the visual findings, offering a deeper understanding of the dataset.
📊 Visualizations

Here are some of the key visualizations from the analysis:

Survival Rate by Gender: A bar chart comparing the survival rates of males and females.
Passenger Age Distribution: A histogram showing the age distribution of passengers.
Class and Fare Analysis: A boxplot visualizing the relationship between passenger class and fare prices.
